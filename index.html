<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Iâ€™m Meixian Li, a PhD student in Linguistics at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research lies at the intersection of phonetics and sociolinguistics, with a particular focus on voice quality and how it interacts with speaker identity factors such as gender, age, and language background. I am especially interested in how bilingual speakers produce and perceive this phonetic variation, and how their languages interact and influence one another. At PolyU, I work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yao-yao-linguistics/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Yao Yao</a> and <a href="https://cbchang.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Charles B. Chang</a> on a project examining the social meanings of creaky voice in Mandarin Chinese.</p> <p>My academic background bridges speech-language pathology and linguistics. I completed my M.S. in Speech-Language Pathology at the MGH Institute of Health Professions, where I studied feedback-based probabilistic learning in children with developmental language disorder. I received my B.A. in Speech, Language &amp; Hearing Science from The George Washington University, during which I gained early research experience in the language acquisition of bilingual children. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a speech-language pathologist in the Massachusetts Public School System for one year.</p> </body></html>
